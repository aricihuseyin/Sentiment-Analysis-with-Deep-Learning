# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify product reviews from the internet as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze product reviews from a dataset and determine the emotional sentiments conveyed within them. The reviews in the dataset are labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. A model is trained using deep learning methods, which can then be used to classify new reviews as either positive or negative.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Open the `model_training.ipynb` file and train the model.
2. Use the trained model to classify new reviews by utilizing the `predict_sentiment.ipynb` file.
